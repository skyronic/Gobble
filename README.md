Gobble!
=======

Gobble is a plugin for sublime text which makes your backspace slightly more intelligent if you edit source code. If you're at the start of an indented line, and press "backspace", you will move the code to the same indentation level of the same line.

For a better visual explanation of what Gobble does, please watch this video:
